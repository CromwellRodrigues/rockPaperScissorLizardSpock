Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Work through the tasks below, which function as tickets, to build and refine your own rock, paper, scissors game where a player plays against the computer.

Task 0: Make a plan!
As always, before you jump into the code, the first step is to break down your logic and make a plan. This is especially useful when you're coding something more complex, like game logic!

The first step in breaking down the game of rock, paper, scissors might look something like this:

Run the game loop
Store a move choice from a user (rock, paper, or scissors) in a variable
Randomly generate the computer's move and store that in a variable
Compare the two moves using the rock, paper, scissors rules to decide who won
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
Alert the winner and update the scores accordingly (wins, losses, and draws)
Ask the player whether they want to play again
This is a start, but each of these steps can be broken down even further before you code. We've broken these down into the tasks below, but before you read and tackle them, we'd like you to try your hand at planning first.

Reminder of tools that you can use while planning:

A flowchart to visualise the game logic
Recording any assumptions you're making
What information you're storing in variables and when each should be updated
Pseudocode to plan out how you're going to translate your logic into actual code
More about pseudocode
We'd recommend you take about 15 minutes to write out how you'd plan to code the game before diving into the tasks, and compare and contrast how you've planned with the tasks we've written out as you go.

Task 1: Logic
To complete this ticket you will need to write a set of if statements that will determine the winner of rock, paper, scissors.

The two moves should be stored in two variables like so:

let playerMove = "rock";
let computerMove = "paper";
You'll want to hard-code each move in these variables (like the example above) to check each piece of logic at first.

Each time you want to test a different combination of moves, change the hard-coded values for playerMove and computerMove, save the file, and then refresh the page. You'll be making these dynamic very soon!

console.log the expected outcome (whether it's a win, loss, or draw) inside of each if block for now so you can see the outcome when you reload the page while testing each scenario.

This will be deemed as complete when all permutations of the three possible moves for each player have been handled correctly, e.g. rock vs rock is a draw, paper vs rock is a paper win, etc.

Task 2: Function
Take the if statements that you've written and tested and put them into a function. The variables from before should now be taken in as parameters so that you can call the function with any two moves. Instead of printing the result to the console, the function should return:

1 if player1 wins
0 if it is a draw
-1 if player1 loses (player2 wins)
The function should be able to be used like so:

function getWinner(player1, player2) {
  // code goes here...
}

let result = getWinner("rock", "paper");
This will be deemed as complete when the function can be called with any combination of valid moves and returns the appropriate number.

Task 3: User Input
Using prompt, get a user-inputted value for the player move. Then call your function with that value as the player move and the hard-coded computer move. Display the result using alert.

This will be deemed as complete when you can input any move for the player move and hard-code any move for the computer move and see the correct result (1, 0, or -1) in the alert.

Task 4: Computer Player
Write a function that generates a random computer move. Use that function to make a dynamic game where the computer move is randomly chosen every time instead of being hard-coded.

Hint
This will be deemed as complete when the player can input any move in the prompt, the computer move is chosen by random, and the correct result shows in the alert.

Task 5: Game Loop
Now that we have a fully functioning game, our next step is to have it run as many times as people would like to play without having to refresh the page.

Use a while loop and confirm.

This will be deemed as complete when a player can keep playing indefinitely and has the option to stop playing after every round.

Task 6: Scores
Keep track of how many games have been played, as well as the number of wins, losses, and draws.

This will be deemed as complete when this information is displayed after each round.

Task 7: Get the player's name using a prompt
Create a username prompt and use the username the player inputs in the game so that a player can see their name in the messages sent to them.

To make it more uniform, restrict the number of characters a username can be to 10 or fewer.

This will be deemed as complete when the users cannot enter a username longer than 10 characters.

ðŸŒŸ BONUS: Make it so that valid usernames should only start with letters, not numbers or symbols.
ðŸŒŸ EXTRA BONUS: Make it so that the first letter of the username should be capitalised.

Bonus task extensions - pick whichever one(s) you fancy
Bonus A: Extend the logic
Rock, paper scissors is now boring. We need to jazz is up a bit.
Add some more moves that a player can make.
Check out this example:
rock paper scissors lizard spock

Modify your logic to represent your new version of this timeless children's game.

Bonus B: The Clairvoyant Computer
How would you go about making the computer win every time?

How would you go about making it so that the computer wins more often (1/2 the time, 1/4 of the time 90% of the time)?

Plan how you'd go about implementing this (use pseudo-code).

If you have time, see if you can start writing this.

Bonus C: Better Presentation
How would you present the information in a better, more exciting way in the console? For example:

console.table lets you log information as a table
you can set the background colour and foreground colour of what you're logging to the console (search online for ways to do this)
console.clear lets you clear information
you can create ASCII art/images (or get them online) and log them to the console
Get creative. Plan how you'd go about implementing this (use pseudo-code).

If you have time, see if you can build this functionality.

Bonus D:
Keep going! Improve, refactor, look for ways to do things differently, look for new things in JavaScript you haven't used yet that you could integrate! The world is your oyster.
